#### ✅ What is the purpose of testing? What is not?
To verify and validate that the software meets requirements and works as intended. To identify defects before the product goes live.
What is not, Testing is not only about finding bugs—it’s also about improving product quality and ensuring requirement coverage. It is not a one-time activity; it's a continuous part of development.

#### ✅ What are the testing principles?
Testing shows defects, not absence.
Exhaustive testing is impossible.
Test early.
Defect clustering.
Avoid pesticide paradox.
Context matters.
No error ≠ useful product.
#### ✅ What is unit testing? Who is responibile to write unit tests?
Testing individual code units (functions/classes).
Developer is responsible.
#### ✅ What are Test Levels, what is the difference between them?
Unit – Individual components.
Integration – Interactions between units.
System – Whole system.
Acceptance – From end-user perspective.
#### ✅ What is the difference between verification and validation?
Verification: Are we building the product right?
Validation: Are we building the right product?
#### ✅ What are Testing Types, what is the difference between them?
Functional vs Non-functional: What it does vs how it does.
Manual vs Automated: Human-run vs tool-run.
#### ✅ What is the difference between white box, grey boy and black box testing?
White box: Full code knowledge.
Black box: No code knowledge.
Grey box: Partial knowledge.
#### ✅ What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?
UAT: Done by users, checks business needs.
System Testing: Done by testers, checks system functionality.
#### ✅ Mention the differences between Regression Testing, Smoke Testing and Retesting?
Regression: Check nothing is broken.
Smoke: Basic functionality check.
Retesting: Check if a bug is fixed.
#### ✅ What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Testing?
Static: No code execution.
Dynamic: Code is executed.
#### ✅ Compare V-modell, Waterfall, Agile from testing perspective!
